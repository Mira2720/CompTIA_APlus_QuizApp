## 📋 Description

This Python quiz application was built as a portfolio project to demonstrate hands-on programming skills, especially in the context of IT certification preparation. While the structure and logic mirror what an actual CompTIA A+ certification quiz would be like, **the questions used in this version are not real exam questions** due to copyright restrictions. They are **sample placeholders** that can be swapped out with official content by authorized parties if needed.

## 🚀 Features

- Terminal + GUI modes
- Select between **Core 1** and **Core 2**
- Category-based filtering (e.g., Networking, Hardware, Security)
- Difficulty levels: Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced
- Real-time feedback with explanations
- Score tracking with result saving in `quiz_results.json`

## 🧠 Why this project?

I built this as a Capstone-style portfolio project that:
- Combines real certification structure with hands-on Python
- Highlights key IT domains I've studied, including:
  - **CompTIA A+**
  - **Google Data Analytics**
  - **Codecademy Python, SQL, and R certificates**
